# Edit-Gemini

This plugin allows users to create .gmi files and edit them as markdown files, for use with the Gemini web protocol.

### Compatibility
The required APIs were added in Obsidian **0.11.0**, so that's the minimum required version.

## How to Use
- Press "New Gemtext" in the side ribbon or file context menu to create an untitled .gmi file
- Select any .gmi file in the file viewer to start editing

## Installation
- Download the latest release and extract the zip into `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins`
- Disable Safe Mode if needed and enable the plugin from the Installed Plugins list.
